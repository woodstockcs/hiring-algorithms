# Hiring Algorithms

## Goal
Use python loops, variables, and conditionals to explore these questions:
- What does it mean to design a fair algorithm?
- What is the human cost of efficiency?
- What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?

## Part 0
1. Spend a few minutes browsing the following resources to (re-)familiarizing yourself with python:
- [operators](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-operators/)
- [lists](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-list/)
- [nested lists](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-nested-list/)
- [if else](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-if-else-elif-statement/)
- [for loops](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-for-loop/)

## Part 1
1. Read the instructions for Part 1 here.
1. Access the mentioned code files here (`hiring.py`) and here (`lottaApps.py`).
1. Update the `hiring.py` file as described in the instructions.
1. When you are done, head back to google classroom and write up the answers for Part 1 in the assignment doc. *Do not turn in this doc yet, because you'll use it in part 2 below.*

## Part 2
1. Read the stories in Part 2 here.
1. For each story, find an appropriate place in your code to add a comment indicating how your algorithm handles that situation. For example: for Story 1, look for a spot where you might want to add a comment like ` # all grades must be entered on a 100-point scale`. 
1. For at least one of the stories, update your code to handle that type of situation in a way that you would consider "more fair".
1. When you are done, head back to google classroom and write up the answers for Part 2 in the assignment doc, then turn it in.
